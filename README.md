# course-projects
All my projects from the javascript course. Created for the purpose of learning.
Projects were created while learning The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! by Jonas Schmedtman

What did I learn?
- variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more
- modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more
- how JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.
- deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.
- deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
